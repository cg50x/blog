Hey there! I finally started my blog. My main goals for this blog are to:

* write about new ideas/concepts that I learn
* provide a beginner-friendly explanation of seemingly complex concepts
* and get better at writing :)

I've got a big list of topics to write and learn about. So far, I started to write the outline for the first one, and it's looking good. I'm looking forward to getting into the habit of writing.

See you in the next post!

PS I need to find better stock photos...
